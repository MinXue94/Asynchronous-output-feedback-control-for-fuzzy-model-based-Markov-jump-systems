# Asynchronous-output-feedback-control-for-fuzzy-model-based-Markov-jump-systems
This project allows you to solve a convex optimization problem and, hence, acieving the controller gians and the optimal dissipative performance. 
### Prerequisites
For running the project you need to instal Matlab 2016b or newer versions and LMI Toolbox. 
## Description
### The system model
We use an example of a single-link robot arm system. The system matrices, transition probability matrix, conditional probability matrix, dissipative parameters, probability of packet dropouts are given.
### The asynchronous output feedback controller
The designed controller has been built as an output feedback controller based on a hidden Markov model and a compensation scheme. The computed by ving a LQR-LMI problem
