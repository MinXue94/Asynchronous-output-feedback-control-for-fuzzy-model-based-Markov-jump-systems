# Asynchronous-output-feedback-control-for-fuzzy-model-based-Markov-jump-systems
This project allows you to solve a convex optimization problem and, hence, acieving the controller gians and the optimal dissipative performance. 
## Prerequisites
For running the project you need to instal Matlab 2016b or newer versions and LMI Toolbox. 
# Description
## The system model
## The asynchronous output feedback controller
